##### Collaborators: 

##### Instructions: #####

Before beginning this assignment, please ensure you have access to R and RStudio.

1. Download the `problemset2.Rmd` file from Canvas. Open `problemset2.Rmd` in RStudio and supply your solutions to the assignment by editing `problemset2.Rmd`.

2. Replace the "Insert Your Name Here" text in the `author:` field with your own full name. Any collaborators must be listed on the top of your assignment. 

3. Be sure to include well-documented (e.g. commented) code chucks, figures and clearly written text chunk explanations as necessary. Any figures should be clearly labeled and appropriately referenced within the text. If you are using more than just a standard function that you found from another source, please credit the source in the comments. For example: 

```{r citing, include=FALSE}
# code adapted from "Example: Multiplication Table"  
# https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/examples/multiplication-table/


# assign num
num = 8
# use for loop to iterate 10 times
for(i in 1:10) {
print(paste(num,'x', i, '=', num*i))
}
```

4. Collaboration on problem sets is acceptable, and even encouraged, but each student must turn in an individual write-up in his or her own words and his or her own work. The names of all collaborators must be listed on each assignment. Do not copy-and-paste from other students' responses or code.

5. When you have completed the assignment and have **checked** that your code both runs in the Console and knits correctly when you click `Knit PDF` or `Knit Word`, rename the R Markdown file to `YourLastName_YourFirstName_ps1.Rmd`, knit a PDF or DOC and submit both the PDF/DOC and the Rmd file on Canvas.

##### Setup: #####

In this problem set you will need, at minimum, the following R packages.

```{r Setup, message=FALSE}
# Load standard libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
library(jsonlite)
```

#### Problem 1: Open Government Data ####

Use the following code to obtain data on the Seattle Police Department Police Report Incidents.

```{r}
police_incidents <- fromJSON("https://data.seattle.gov/resource/hapq-73pk.json")
```

##### (a) Describe, in detail, what the data represents. 

##### (b) Describe each variable and what it measures. Be sure to note when data is missing. Confirm that each variable is appropriately cast - it has the correct data type. If any are incorrect, recast them to be in the appropriate format. 

##### (c) Produce a clean dataset, according to the rules of tidy data discussed in class. Export the data for future analysis using the Rdata format. 

##### (d) Describe any concerns you might have about this data. This may include biases, missing data, or ethical concerns.

#### Problem 2:  Wrangling the NYC Flights Data ####

In this problem set we will use the data on all flights that departed NYC (i.e. JFK, LGA or EWR) in 2013. You can find this data in the `nycflights13` R package. 

##### (a) Importing Data: ##### 
Load the data. 

```{r}
# Edit me.
```

##### (b) Data Manipulation: ##### 
Use the flights data to answer each of the following questions. Be sure to answer each question with a written response and supporting analysis.

- How many flights were there from NYC airports to Minneapolis/St.Paul in 2013?
```{r}
# Edit me.
```

- How many airlines fly from NYC to Minneapolis/St.Paul?
```{r}
# Edit me.
```

- How many unique airplanes fly from NYC to Minneapolis/St.Paul?
```{r}
# Edit me.
```

- What is the average arrival delay for flights from NYC to Minneapolis/St.Paul?
```{r}
# Edit me.
```

- What proportion of flights to Minneapolis/St.Paul come from each NYC airport?

```{r}
# Edit me.
```
